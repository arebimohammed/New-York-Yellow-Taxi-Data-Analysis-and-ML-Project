## Presentation Notebook Tutorial ##

A Jupyter notebook can be turned into presentation slides thank to the [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) jupyter extension.
I used this extension to turn the analysis I conducted into a slideshow, with some modifications and add-ons such as toggling and hiding code cells and
some styling of the description and title cells.

#### How to use RISE

You can check how to use RISE using the link to its homepage (linked above) but I also show the reader here how it can be done as well.
First and foremost install RISE using either pip or conda if you're using Anaconda. With that a new button will be displayed at the top 
of your Jupyter notebook (see video below). This will create the slideshow. You have the option to change the slide type for each individual cell, options
include skipping the cell altogether, having it as a main or sub slide or a fragment and having a notes cell. This can be done by going to 
View -> Cell Toolbar -> Slideshow. From there you can start your slideshow :heart_eyes:!
