# New-York-Yellow-Taxi-Data-Analysis-and-ML-Project :taxi:
This repository hold all the code, data and figures for the analysis and machine learning code of the New York Yellow Taxi Dataset

This project is accompanied with a blog post on my website that goes through the analysis and the results it can be found [here](https://arebimohammed.github.io/new-york-taxi-analysis/) :open_book:
